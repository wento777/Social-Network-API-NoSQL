# Social-Network-API-NoSQL



 ## Description 

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 18 Challenge, NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API.

- This challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

-  Writing about tech can be just as important as making it.

- MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.


- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

- Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

- Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

- A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels.

 ## Installation

  - There is no starter code for this assignment.

  - In order to install inquirer, i used npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

  - The application will be deployed by using the following command: 'npm start'.



## Usage

  - This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the first ten weeks of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

  - Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

  - I will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.jsLinks to an external site. and MongooseLinks to an external site. packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

  - Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.
  




## User Story

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list


 ## Contribute 

 -  Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.

- This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the first ten weeks of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

- Your application should use JestLinks to an external site. for running the unit tests and InquirerLinks to an external site. for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:
node index.js

- Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

- Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.

- Refer to the Video Submission Guide Links to an external site.on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.
  
## Tests

  - This application will be tested in Insomnia.

## Summary

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, i will use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that I understand how to build and structure the API first.
